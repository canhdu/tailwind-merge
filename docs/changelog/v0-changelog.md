## v0.8.0

### Summary

This is a big release with breaking changes. These were necessary to improve the API before the coming v1.0.0 release and to add better plugin support. If you feel like writing a plugin, check out the [plugins section](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/tree/v0.8.0#writing-plugins) in the docs!

### Breaking Changes

- Previously there was a list of prefixes in the tailwind-merge config which was used to match Tailwind prefixes. I removed those and match all prefixes as valid Tailwind prefixes. This is only a breaking change if you use non-Tailwind classes with `:` in them which look like Tailwind classes after the prefix. tailwind-merge will treat those as Tailwind classes and resolve conflicts incorrectly. [#50](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/pull/50))
- `createTailwindMerge`
    - If you added custom prefixes to your tailwind-merge config, you can remove them now. If you use TypeScript, you need to remove them. ([#50](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/pull/50))
    - Doesn't get passed the `getDefaultConfig` callback anymore. You need to call the exported function [`getDefaultConfig`](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/tree/v0.8.0#getdefaultconfig) instead to get the default config. ([#42](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/pull/42))
    - You probably don't need `createTailwindMerge` anyway. Use the new and much simpler to use [`extendTailwindMerge`](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/tree/v0.8.0#extendtailwindmerge) instead. ([#49](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/pull/49))

### New Features

- Add plugin documentation by [@dcastil](https://github.com/dcastil) in [#51](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/pull/51)
- (Breaking change) Consider all prefixes as valid Tailwind prefixes by [@dcastil](https://github.com/dcastil) in [#50](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/pull/50)
- Add `extendTailwindMerge` function by [@dcastil](https://github.com/dcastil) in [#49](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/pull/49)
- Add `mergeConfigs` function by [@dcastil](https://github.com/dcastil) in [#45](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/pull/45)
- (Breaking change) Code-split default config out by [@dcastil](https://github.com/dcastil) in [#42](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/pull/42)
- Enable multiple `createConfig` functions by [@dcastil](https://github.com/dcastil) in [#40](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/pull/40)

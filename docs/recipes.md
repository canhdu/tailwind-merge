How to configure tailwind-merge with some common patterns.

## Adding custom scale from Tailwind config to tailwind-merge config

> I have a custom shadow scale with the keys 100, 200 and 300 configured in Tailwind. How do I make tailwind-merge resolve conflicts among those?

We'll be able to do this by creating a custom `twMerge` functon with [`extendTailwindMerge`](./api-reference.md#extendtailwindmerge).

First, we need to know whether we want to override or extend the default scale. Let's say we extended the default config by putting the scale into the `extend` key in the Tailwind config.

Then we check whether our particular theme scale is included in tailwind-merge's theme config object [here](./configuration.md#theme). In the hypothetical case that tailwind-merge supported Tailwind's `boxShadow` theme scale, we could add it to the tailwind-merge config like this:

```js
import { extendTailwindMerge } from 'tailwind-merge'

const twMerge = extendTailwindMerge({
    extend: {
        theme: {
            // The `boxShadow` key isn't actually supported
            boxShadow: [{ shadow: ['100', '200', '300'] }],
        },
    },
})
```

In the case of the `boxShadow` scale, tailwind-merge doesn't include it in the theme object. Instead, we need to check out the [default config of tailwind-merge](../src/lib/default-config.ts) and search for the class group ID of the box shadow scale. After a quick search we find that tailwind-merge is using the key `shadow` for that group. We can add our custom classes to that group like this:

```js
import { extendTailwindMerge } from 'tailwind-merge'

const twMerge = extendTailwindMerge({
    extend: {
        classGroups: {
            shadow: [{ shadow: ['100', '200', '300'] }],
        },
    },
})
```

Note that by using the `extend` object we're only adding our custom classes to the existing ones in the config, so `twMerge('shadow-200 shadow-lg')` will return the string `shadow-lg`. If we want to override the class instead, we need to use the `override` object instead.

## Extracting classes with Tailwind's [`@apply`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#extracting-classes-with-apply)

> How do I make tailwind-merge resolve conflicts with a custom class created with `@apply`?
>
> ```css
> .btn-primary {
>     @apply py-2 px-4 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700;
> }
> ```

I don't recommend using Tailwind's `@apply` directive for classes that might get processed with tailwind-merge.

tailwind-merge would need to be configured so that it knows about which classes `.btn-primary` is in conflict with. This means: If someone adds another Tailwind class to the `@apply` directive, the tailwind-merge config would need to get modified accordingly, keeping it in sync with the written CSS. This easy-to-miss dependency is fragile and can lead to bugs with incorrect merging behavior.

Instead of creating custom CSS classes, I recommend keeping the collection of Tailwind classes in a string variable in JavaScript and access it whenever you want to apply those styles. This way you can reuse the collection of styles but don't need to touch the tailwind-merge config.

```jsx
// React components with JSX syntax used in this example

import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge'

const BTN_PRIMARY_CLASSNAMES = 'py-2 px-4 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700'

function ButtonPrimary(props) {
    return <button {...props} className={twMerge(BTN_PRIMARY_CLASSNAMES, props.className)} />
}
```

## Modifying inputs and output of `twMerge`

> How do I make `twMerge` accept the same argument types as clsx/classnames?

You can wrap `twMerge` in another function which can modify the inputs and/or output.

```js
import { twMerge as twMergeOriginal } from 'tailwind-merge'

function twMerge(...inputs) {
    const modifiedInputs = modifyInputs(inputs)
    return twMergeOriginal(modifiedInputs)
}
```
